    abstract = { This study explores the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Canadian hospitals from 2000 to 2021, focusing on metropolitan areas. We investigate how local public and private research ecosystems and links to national and international AI hubs influence the adoption of AI in healthcare. Our analysis shows that AI research outputs from public institutions have a significant impact on AI competences in hospitals. In addition, collaborations between hospitals are critical to the successful integration of AI. Metropolitan areas such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver are leading the way in AI deployment. These findings highlight the importance of local AI research capabilities and international hospital collaborations and provide guidance to policy-makers and health leaders to drive the diffusion of AI technology in healthcare. }
